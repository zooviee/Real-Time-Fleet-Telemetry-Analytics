# Project Status: In Progress
This project is currently under active development.<br>
I am building a real-time fleet telemetry analytics platform that streams and processes vehicle data using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink. The goal is to design a low-latency, scalable pipeline capable of handling continuous telemetry events and producing real-time insights.<br>
Planned and ongoing work includes:
- Kafka producers and topics for ingesting vehicle telemetry data.
- Flink streaming jobs for real-time transformations and aggregations.
- Event-time processing and windowed analytics.
- Data quality checks and anomaly detection.
- Scalable sinks for analytics and monitoring dashboards.
- Performance tuning and fault-tolerance configuration.<br>
Some components may still be experimental or incomplete as the project evolves.<br>
This repository represents my live development process and will progressively showcase a production-grade real-time streaming architecture.<br>
